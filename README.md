# Implementation-of-K-Means-Clustering-for-Customer-Segmentation

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the K Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. mport the required libraries,read the data set.find the number of null data.
2.Find the number of null data.
3.Import sklearn library.
4.Find y predict and plot the graph.


## Program:
```
